Contributing
============

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! We highly
appreciate your effort towards enhancing our project.

SelfEEG is designed to help buil Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
experiments on electroencephalography (EEG) data, hoping that various
teams working on this or related areas will find this project useful for
their research purposes.

Before getting started, please take a moment to review the following
guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration.

Before you start
----------------

If you are new to selfEEG or self-supervised learning in general, we
recommend you do the following before start working on the code:

-  Read the `Code of Conduct <https://github.com/MedMaxLab/selfEEG>`__
-  Familiarize yourself with the library. Introductory notebooks in the
   `Notebooks <https://github.com/MedMaxLab/selfEEG/Notebooks>`__ folder
   are a good starting point.
-  Read about the self-supervised learning paradigm. The literature
   offers many review papers about this topic. Our recent
   `review <https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Applications_of_Self-Supervised_Learning_to_Biomedical_Signals_where_are_we_now/22567021>`__
   can be a good starting point.

How to contribute
-----------------

You can contribute to this library by reporting and solving issues,
or by proposing and implementing novel features. Both contributions
are very welcome.

Reporting issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you come across any issues or bugs in the project, you can report
them via our `issue <https://github.com/MedMaxLab/selfEEG/issues>`__
section. Please ensure that you provide sufficient information to
reproduce the issue.

Suggesting enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have any suggestions for new features, improvements or
enhancements, you can either open a new issue detailing your proposal or
write directly to our group. We highly value your input and will gladly
review your suggestions.

The following (not exhaustive) list of possible additions, sorted by
priority order, can be used as a reference:

-  add novel self-supervised learning algorithms
-  add novel reproducibility features
-  add models for EEG-analysis
-  improve data augmentation performances
-  add functionalities for other biosignals often included in EEG data
   analysis

Getting started
---------------

To start contributing, follow these simple steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your contribution.
4. Set up a python virtual environment.
5. Make necessary changes/additions to the source code.
6. Commit your changes using descriptive commit messages.
7. Push your changes to your forked repository.
8. Open a pull request to our repository, describing your changes and
   their benefits.
9. Wait for our review and discuss together with us how to merge your
   additions.

More details about setting your working environment and how to prepare
your pulling request can be found in the next sections

Set up a Python virtual environment
-----------------------------------

To work on your changes you first need to setup a virtual environment.
Just create a fresh environment, activate it and pip install the library
with its dependencies.

We suggest working with conda (or miniconda), where a new environment
can be easily created with the following commands:

::

   conda create -n selfeegDev python=3
   conda activate selfeegDev

To install the library with its dependencies, run the following command
using the project main directory as the working directory:

::

   pip install -e .

this will install all the selfeeg main dependencies. As reported in the
`README.md <https://github.com/MedMaxLab/selfEEG/blob/main/README.md>`__ file, we suggest to also add jupyter-lab,
matplotib, and scikit-learn, which can facilitate the development and
testing of novel features.

testing
-------

It is important to ensure that all the implemented changes will not
break any existing library functionality. The `test <https://github.com/MedMaxLab/selfEEG/tree/main/test>`__ folder
provides an automatic way to check all the library functionalities.
Tests will be performed automatically via GitHub Actions whenever changes to the test, selfeeg, or .github/workflows folders 
are pushed to the remote repository. However, these tests are performed only on the CPU device. 
For these reasons, it is strongly suggested to perform tests locally before any push, in order to evaluate the 
selfEEG functionalities also on a GPU device. 
Local tests can be performed with unittest by simply running the following command using the main repository directory as the working directory:

::

   python3 -m unittest discover test "*_test.py"

Remember to add test functionalities if you are working on novel
features. More detail about tests can be found in the readme file in the
test folder. For further info on what assertion you must include, take a look at the test's folder `readme <https://github.com/MedMaxLab/selfEEG/blob/main/test/README.md>`__

Submitting Pull Requests
------------------------

If you believe that your changes are ready for possible merging with our
main branch, it is time to send us a pull request, clearly explaining
your changes and their purpose. Before submitting a pull request we
kindly ask you to ensure that:

1. Existing tests can be run without errors
2. Novel tests were added to check that an issue is solved or a novel
   feature works correctly.
3. Additions are properly documented and ready to be included without
   errors in our API documentation.
4. The code style follow that of the project. In particular, check that:

   -  indentations follow a 4 space rule.
   -  comments are provided wherever necessary for clarity.
   -  The input arguments order is similar to that of other similar
      functions.

5. commit messages are clear, descriptive, and provide concise summaries
   that conveys its purpose.

After submitting a pull request, rest assured that everything will be
done to provide a response as soon as possible.
