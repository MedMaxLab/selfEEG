    "\n",
    "1) Define the **partition specs**, i.e. the EEGs' sampling rate, the window length and the overlap between consecutive windows.\n",
    "2) Call the **GetEEGPartitionNumber** function to extract the dataset length, i.e. the sum of all the partitions which can be extracted from each EEG with the defined partition specs.\n",
    "3) Call the **GetEEGSplitTable** or the **GetEEGSplitTableKfold** to split the data in train, validation and test set.\n",
    "4) Pass the results of the previous points to the custom Pytorch Dataset **EEGDataset**\n",
    "5) Optional: create a custom Pytorch Sampler **EEGSampler**\n",
    "6) Create a **Pytorch Dataloader** with the custom Dataset (and Sampler)"

To initialize the sampler in this mode, simply use the command <br> <code> EEGSampler( EEGDataset, Mode=0)</code>\n",
