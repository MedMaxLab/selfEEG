    "\n",
    "In short, all functions and custom classes are designed to help you create an efficient Pytorch Dataloader to use during training. The main objective is to avoid loading the entire dataset all at once, but instead iteratively load (possibly overlapping) time windows called \"partitions\". A typical pipeline is based on the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Define the **partition specs**, i.e. the EEGs' sampling rate, the window length and the overlap between consecutive windows.\n",
    "2) Call the **GetEEGPartitionNumber** function to extract the dataset length, i.e. the number of partitions which can be extracted from the EEG datasets, given the defined partition specs.\n",
    "3) Call the **GetEEGSplitTable** or the **GetEEGSplitTableKfold** function to split the data in train, validation and test sets.\n",
    "4) Pass the results of the previous points to the custom Pytorch Dataset **EEGDataset**\n",
    "5) Optional: create a custom Pytorch Sampler **EEGSampler**\n",
    "6) Create a **Pytorch Dataloader** with the custom Dataset (and Sampler)"
