selfeeg.ssl
===========

The ssl module collects different self-supervised learning algorithms applied for the analysis
of EEG Data. Each algorithm included an already implemented fit and test method, to speed up the pretraining process. 
In addition, this module includes an implementation of the fine-tuning function that can also be used as a standalone fit method.
